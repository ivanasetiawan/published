You taught me to be regret-less,\\
And I am trying my best to understand how,\\
When you are the main source of my regret.\\
It’s never your fault, nor mine. Just situations.  

Anyway, I got diagnosed with autism.\\
That’s why my brain obsesses certain things like a maniac.\\
Something some close friends were already suspicious about.\\
All I wish is I knew it earlier, so I could notify you.\\
Who knows, maybe you could handle me better.

I phoned you 3726 miles away, you sounded so you.\\
You seemed to be shocked that I still remember the story about your mom. \\
Of course I do, you’ve always been my main amuser.\\
I know I acted like a dumb fuck most of the time.\\
But all of the detail information you shared with me stored perfectly untouched in my brain.\\
It’s just that.. I cannot communicate how I feel fluently-aligned with my behaviour, \\
It seems like I push people away when I like them the most.\\
I don’t have to explain to you of course.. You experienced it yourself.
