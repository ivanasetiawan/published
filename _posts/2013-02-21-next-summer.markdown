Next summer might be fun. I think.  
I am over you at least. I think.  
OK. I promise I won't expect, nor think.  

Funny how I am back and forth and inside out about these three letters.\\
Is it still too funny for you that I was so crazy for you last year, the year before and the year before that?\\
One day before yesterday I still wondered if I could finally be good enough for anyone.  
Not just anyone - I mean for you and you for me.  

Next summer might be fun..  
I think..  
I am over you at least.  
Again, I promise I won't expect, nor think.  

But I really hope it won't be you, like last time at Westerpark.\\
I was so unhappy. Just in case you're wondering. \\
I know you won't. I just hope you would. \\
I lost my self slowly getting to know you.
